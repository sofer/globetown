      <!-- WHAT WE DO -->

      <p class="small-title"><strong>What we do</strong></p>
      <p>We provide high quality technical training to help our students express their creativity and solve real world problems.</p>

      <!-- MORE THAN EDUCATION -->

      <p class="small-title"><strong>More than education</strong></p>
      <p>The most important thing we do is expose our students the hacker culture. Although we provide materials and guidance we believe that being able to bootstrap solutions and develop curiosity is far more important than raw knowledge.</p>
      <span class="space"></span>
      <p>The second most important thing is community. Nobody, however brilliant, can do it all on their own. Being able to work as part of a team is vital to successful software development and entrepreneurship.</p>

      <!-- FORMAT -->

      <p class="small-title"><strong>Format</strong></p>
      <p>We split our cohort in groups of 4 students and introduce a new technology and challenge every week. We run a workshop at the beginning of each week and a presentation day at the end of it. We continuously encourage everyone to discuss their problems and present their solutions.</p>

      <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->

      <p class="small-title"><strong>Philosophy</strong></p>
      <p>We aim to create a good environment where student can be productive. We realize that applying technology in real world problem is the best way to learn, so once we run the workshop and set the challenge we leave our students complete independence and intervene only if needed. As the weeks go by we hope every student will have a deeper understanding of what they want to do after the course.</p>
      <span class="space"></span>
      <p>We believe that the best teams are diverse, that is why our students are 50% women and men and come from a range of backgrounds and expertise.</p>

      <h1>Selection process</h1>
      <p>
        The application process is divided in two parts.
        <ul>
          <li><a href="/application_1/">Application form, Part 1 (the shorter one)</a></li>
          <li><a href="/application_2/">Application form, Part 2 (the longer one)</a></li>
        <ul>
      </ul></ul></p>
      <span class="space"></span>
      <h2>Deadlines</h2>
      <p>
        The application deadline is 30 June 2016 while the course will start on July 11. We do recommend that applicants apply early, but your application will not be considered until you have met all of the minimum application criteria. You will remain in the applicant pool until you have been offered a place or all the places have been filled, which you will be notified of within two weeks of the final application deadline.
      </p>
      <span class="space"></span>
      <h2>Selection criteria</h2>
      <p>
        We receive many applications for each place and selection is highly competitive. We will expect you to have started on your journey to become a software developer before you join us on the programme.
        <span class="space"></span>
        <ul>
          <li>Record your voice at an adequate sound level on your video and keep it to under two minutes;</li>
          <li>Reach at least 5 kyu on <a href="http://www.codewars.com/?language=javascript">Codewars</a>;</li>
          <li>Create some kata on <a href="http://www.codewars.com/kata/new">CodeWars</a>;</li>
          <li>Contribute to <a href="https://github.com/codingforeveryone">our community on GitHub</a>(in particular, our <a href="https://github.com/codingforeveryone/READMEs">READMEs</a>);</li>
          <li>Contribute to <a href="https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone">our Gitter chatroom</a></li>
        </ul>
        <span class="space"></span>
        </p><p>If you have no coding experience, creating kata on Codewars and getting familiar with GitHub will take time.</p>
        <p>But please do not be daunted. We encourage you to seek help and encouragement from other applicants. Join us on GitHub, use our Gitter channel, and if you live in London consider signing up for our <a href="http://www.meetup.com/founderscoders/">Monday evening meetups</a>.</p>

      <p class="small-title"><strong>Prerequisites</strong></p>
      <h1>Course prerequisites</h1>
      <p>
        We have chosen these resources as our entrance criteria. If you are not comfortable coding at this standard by the time the course starts you may struggle. These tasks are part of how we will measure whether you are a good candidate for the course as well as whether you can learn in the collaborative environment here. You do not need to have completed these prerequisites before you send in your application, but you should at least have made a good start on them.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Complete Beginners</strong><br>If you are completely new to coding, run through these Codecademy tracks first (in this order).</p>
      <span class="space"></span>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web">HTML &amp; CSS</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/skills/make-a-website">Make a Website</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript">Javascript</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/youtube">YouTube API</a></li>
      </ul>
      <span class="space"></span>
      <p>We are not looking for a row of 100% completed tracks, if you have studied this before you can skip sections but you will need to understand the full content above.</p>
      <p>After those tracks, run through <a href="http://flukeout.github.io/">CSS Diner</a> (we love this!), to reinforce CSS selectors.</p>
      <p><strong>Codewars</strong><br>We want you to reach at least <strong>5kyu</strong> on <a href="http://codewars.com">codewars</a>. This is going to take a minimum of 3 weeks and more likely a few months depending on how much time you can spend working on it.</p>
      <p>It takes a while to get the hang of Codewars (it's quite different to and a jump up from Codecademy). We've written our own guide to Codecademy and Codewars <a href="https://github.com/codingforeveryone/learning-with-codewars-and-codecademy">here</a>, which will help you on your way.</p>
      <p>You might feel like you need more preparation. If so, take a look at chapters 1-4 of <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf">Eloquent Javascript</a>.  It's helpful for understanding functions and their uses in Javascript and builds nicely on where Codecademy ends.</p>
      <p>If you find yourself struggling or want to meet other learners, come along to our <a href="www.meetup.com/founderscoders/">Monday evening meetups</a> where we can help. We also run Coding for Women on every other Tuesday.</p>
      <p>Finally, sign up to Stack Overflow and look at some answers given for Javascript questions. The community can be a little intolerant of duplicated questions, so we'll brief on the techniques for asking questions when you arrive. Come join our Gitter channel where we chat about Codewars, Codecademy and other learning resources.</p>
      <p><strong>Recommended</strong><br>We won't judge you as a candidate on these grounds, and they are not completely necessary, but they will put you in a better place for the course.</p>
      <p>Codecademy tracks we would recommend:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-intermediate-en-NJ7Lr/0/1">Regex</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/courses/javascript-lesson-205/0/1">Recursion</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>It would help greatly for you to be a relatively quick typist. <a href="https://www.typingclub.com/">Typing Club</a> is good (and free).</p>
      <p>Learn some hotkeys on your computer. It will help with switching between programs on your computer, using your browser efficiently and so on.</p>
      <p>Reading <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/Eloquent_JavaScript.pdf">Eloquent Javascript</a> is a good idea, but it can get heavy after Chapter 4, so don't worry if you find it difficult as it will start to make sense during the course. <a href="http://bdcampbell.net/javascript/book/javascript_the_good_parts.pdf">Javascript: The Good Parts</a> is written by the God of Javascript, Douglas Crockford, but the diagrams are difficult to follow and it gets equally heavy as Eloquent.</p>
      <p>Watch parts 2 and 3 of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxAXlJEmNMg&amp;list=PL7664379246A246CB">Crockford on JavaScript</a>. A wonderful series of lectures by the same Crockford as above. A panoramic overview of JavaScript at an advanced level. These two talks are hard to follow, but anything you can take from them is valuable.</p>
      <span class="space"></span>
      <p class="small-title"><strong>Extras</strong></p>
      <h2>Further material</h2>
      <p>If you have some spare time, or fancy a break from Codewars, these resources are just for fun!</p>
      <p><strong>Reading</strong><br><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/">Paul Ford - What is Code?</a> is a great article about his impression of the tech industry and the life of a programmer. It's long, but quite light to read.</p>
      <p><a href="https://plus.google.com/+RipRowan/posts/eVeouesvaVX">Steve Yegge's Google platforms rant</a> shows you how passionate someone can be about their tech company's philosophy.</p>
      <p><strong>Watching</strong><br><a href="https://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle</a>, a talk by Bret Victor.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Tk09c0FQ3M&amp;feature=youtu.be">Computer Science: Past, Present, and Future</a>, a talk by Ed Lazowska.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o&amp;feature=youtu.be">The Future Doesn't Have to Be Incremental</a>, a talk by Alan Kay.</p>
